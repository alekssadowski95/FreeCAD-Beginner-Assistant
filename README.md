# FreeCAD Beginner Assistant (FreeCAD Addon)


The FreeCAD Beginner Assistant gives interactive feedback on best practices for beginning FreeCAD users. It does it by analysing a FreeCAD FCStd-file containing at least one part made with the Part Design and Sketcher workbenches and gives real-time or asynchronous feedback, based on best practices, on what was done well and what can be improved by the user.

**Report-type (asynchronous) feedback**

## Vision
With FCViewer now having more than 1000 uploads, I have analysed the FreeCAD files that were uploaded. Many uploaded files are not created using established best practices known in the FreeCAD community and from CAD specialists in general. With the FreeCAD Beginner Assistant we want to teach users to apply these known best practices. 
- Get asynchronous feedback with best practices in FCViewer.
- Get real-time feedback with best practices in FreeCAD.

-> Increase the quality of community-created projects and increase the popularity of FreeCAD as a result.
